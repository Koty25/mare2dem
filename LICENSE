! MARE2DEM: Modeling with Adaptively Refined Elements for 2.5D EM
!
! A parallel goal-oriented adaptive finite element forward and inverse
! modeling code for electromagnetic fields from electric dipoles, magnetic
! dipoles and magnetotelluric sources in triaxially anisotropic conducting
! media. Iterative adaptive mesh refinement is accomplished using the
! goal-oriented error estimation method described in Key and Ovall (2011) 
! Inversion is accomplished with Occam's method (Constable et al., 1987).
! Key (2016) describes most of the features in the current 2018 version 
! of the code.
