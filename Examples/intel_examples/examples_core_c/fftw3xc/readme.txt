mkl/examples/fftw3xc directory contains examples of using FFTW3 C interface to
compute various FFT problems.

Each example is a self-contained C program.

The examples are named by the name of the plan function they use.  Prefixes dp_
and sp_ indicate the floating point precision used in the example, double or
single precision, respectively.  For the FFT problems that
Intel(R) Math Kernel Library (Intel(R) MKL) does not support
examples are not provided.

For every FFT computed in the example an initialization and verification
function is provided. Initialization function shows how the input data is
indexed and what input will produce a unit peak in the result. Verification
function checks if the unit peak is produced by the computation.

Every example uses dynamically allocated arrays for the data.  Sizes of the
transforms and parameters for verification are selected randomly.

Refer to FFTW3 documentation for detailed description of the functions used in
these examples.  Refer to Intel MKL Reference Manual for limitations of the FFTW3
interface provided by Intel MKL.

Your feedback on the examples is welcome at Intel MKL Forum site:
